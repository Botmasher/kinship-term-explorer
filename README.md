# Kinship Term Explorer

This app explores the world's kinship terminology around the world. It uses the traditional categories: "Crow", "Omaha", "Dravidian", "Iroquois", "Eskimo", "Sudanese" and "Hawaiian". These buckets are approachable for starters but bring up debates among kinship anthropologists (more on that below).

## Motivation

This is a leadup app for a multimedia project I'm working on that's all about the way languages around the world talk about family trees. I'm really enjoying the topic, but I'm noticing my own need for an easy way to view and navigate the various kinship systems. I want a way to keep their differences straight in my head, and words and diagrams just haven't cut it.

This app helps me do that by illustrating the way kinship terminology changes around the world. It does this based on old standards in kinship anthropology: our world's seven kinship systems. These systems intend to be illustrative look at kinship systems rather than a rigorous or opinionated look at the underlying kinship research.

## Academic basis

The kinship concepts used here are built on the Morgan-Lowie-Murdock tradition of dividing the world's languages and cultures into several kinship systems. Each system is based on standout features, and an archetypal language or region, such as "Sudanese" (for Morgan, highly descriptive) or "Hawaiian" (for Morgan, highly classificatory). These systems are still used for basic breakdowns in research, though with caveats, like in Bennardo's "Space in kinship". In particular, the reasons for slicing up the systems get debated and rejected, such as Morgan's identification of "descriptive" vs "classificatory" systems. Read gives an overview of the drawbacks of this way of classifying kinship terminology in a 2013 paper "A New Approach to Forming a Typology of Kinship Terminology Systems", where the author proposes a more consistent approach.

## Source Code

I tend to write my other project exploration leadup code in Python and have a minimal interface. This leadup calls for a visual approach where info is geometrically positioned and selectable on screen. I'll choose between languages/frameworks with those constraints in mind.
